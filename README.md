<h3> Step 3: It will prompt to ask which product you want to buy and the quantity of it. Then if the desire quantity is fewer or equal to the quantity of that we have in-stock --> It will prompt again to ask for your confirmation. Once you say "yes", it will substract the items out from stock </h3>

<h3> But if the amount order is more than what is available in-stock --> It will say "Sorry..." and will NOT substract anything from the stock quantity. Order cannot be completed  </h3>
